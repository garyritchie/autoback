AUTOBACK QUICKSTART

So, you want to back up your files?

NEW INSTALL: Follow these steps for a NEW installation only.
1. It's recommended you have a dedicated local physical drive, mapped with a letter, such as T:

2. Move or copy the distribution folder AUTOBACK, and its contents, to T:/ so it looks like this:
	T:/autobacktm
	T:/autobacktm/bin
	T:/autobacktm/conf
	T:/autobacktm/store

3. Get Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe
	a. During install, use the defaults, if you wish.
	b. When confronted with the packages screen. View by name and install rsync.

4. Open Control Panel --> Scheduled Tasks and set desired repeating event to launch (WindowsXP):
	T:/autobacktm/bin/autobacktmstarter.bat

5. Edit T:/autobacktm/conf/backup_exclude.conf as desired. It should already contain some settings that you may or may not want.

UPGRADING
You should only need to replace autobacktm.sh and autobacktmstarter.bat
